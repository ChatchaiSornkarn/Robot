Abdulkader:
I did the userRobot, the Main(PacMan) except for restart(), the CpuRobot and the comments.
Chatchai:
Did the restart(), the ImageIcon, the City (ACity).


Just a couple of notes:
I used the Random.java from another package(dit948)so please just import it to the classes.
the second one is that if you have a umm weak laptop just put some delays inside the run method
of the UserRobot (I mean System.out.println() by a delay) because that this game is consuming 
a huge amount of my CPU resources and if you don't do so you won't be able to control the robot 
from the buttons 
the final one is that the UserRobot can be controlled by the KeyBoard and the Buttons 
that's it :D
